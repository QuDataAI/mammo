- __Using Grad-CAM for Lesion Localization in BI-RADS Classification with Deep Neural Networks__  
  This notebook demonstrates the application of Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) on a deep neural network trained for Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification. BI-RADS is a standardized system used by radiologists to categorize findings in mammograms. In addition to classifying BI-RADS categories, we aim to visualize and localize areas within the mammogram that contribute most significantly to the network's decision-making process.
